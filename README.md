## Project Overview
### Business problem
Santa Claus is facing the challenge of scheduling visits for 5,000 families to his workshop over a span of 100 days. Each family has provided a list of preferred dates, but due to high demand, not everyone can get their top choices. Santa aims to optimize the scheduling process to ensure fairness while minimizing additional expenses that may arise from accommodating families' preferences. The goal is to create a schedule that maximizes efficiency and customer satisfaction while minimizing costs.
